How I saved 150+ hours this year (and how you can too)

i spent 10 hours every week doing busywork. then i automated it.

the trap
every small business owner knows this feeling. you didn't start your gym to send follow-up emails. you didn't become an entrepreneur to chase leads or update spreadsheets. you started because you're good at something teaching BJJ, designing, consulting and you wanted to share that skill with the world.

but somewhere along the way, the admin pile grew.

for me, it looked like this:
30 minutes every morning: chasing yesterday's leads
1 hour: scheduling classes and managing waitlists
2 hours: sending invoices and tracking payments
1 hour: following up with members who hadn't shown up
30 minutes: answering the same questions over and over

total: 5 hours per day. 25 hours per week. 1,300 hours per year.
that's 54 full days. gone.

the realization
i was working in my business, not on it.

the successful gym owners i admired weren't working 80-hour weeks. they had systems. they had leverage.

and then it hit me: the "grind" culture is a trap. working harder on the wrong things doesn't build a business it burns you out.

the entrepreneurs who win aren't working more hours. they're working smarter.

the solution
step 1: map everything
i wrote down every recurring task. not the one-off stuff the stuff that happens every day, every week, every month.

step 2: find the pattern
most tasks follow a pattern: trigger (someone signs up) action (send welcome email) response (book first class). if you can identify the pattern, you can automate it.

step 3: start small
don't try to automate everything at once. pick ONE task that: takes the most time, happens most frequently, doesn't require creativity.

for me? it was lead follow-up. i'd get a new inquiry, forget to follow up for 3 days, and lose the lead. every. single. time.

so i built a simple system: when a lead comes in, AI sends a personalized follow-up sequence over 21 days.

results: lead response time went from 3 days to 0 minutes. conversion rate went up because i actually followed up now.

step 4: stack tools
you don't need to be a developer. i used zapier / make to connect your apps, chatgpt to write the messages, google calendar to handle scheduling, and my gym software to track everything.

total cost: less than $50/month.

the result
before automation: 25 hours/week on admin, constant firefighting, no time for growth.

after automation: 2 hours/week on admin, systems that run while i sleep, time to actually improve teaching, connect with members, and grow.

that's 150+ hours saved per year.

what could you do with 150 hours? 5 marathons trained for, 50 books read, a whole extra month of weekends with your family, or 150 hours pouring into growing your business.

the truth
automation isn't about being lazy. it's about being strategic.

you didn't become an entrepreneur to become an admin. you became one to create something, solve problems, and build freedom.

stop grinding. start automating.

your future self will thank you.
