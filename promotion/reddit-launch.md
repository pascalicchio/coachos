# Reddit Launch Post - r/BJJ, r/martialarts, r/entrepreneur

**Title:** Built a gym management tool after 3 years of managing my own BJJ gym - just launched the new version

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

I run 2 BJJ gyms in Florida and I've been using my own software to manage coaches, schedules, and payments for years. Finally decided to clean it up and make it available for other gym owners.

**What it does:**
- Coach scheduling (super simple, no learning curve)
- Payment tracking for coaches
- Private class management
- Coming: Lead management + trial booking

**Why it exists:**
I was tired of expensive, bloated software. I just want to know:
- Who's teaching when
- How much I owe each coach
- Who's coming to trial classes

No spreadsheets. No complicated setup.

**The plan:**
- Free 14-day trial
- $29/mo for small gyms
- $59/mo for multiple locations

Would love some feedback from other gym owners. Happy to answer questions!
