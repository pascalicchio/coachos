Title: Simple gym management tool for gym owners - no learning curve

Body:
I've been running 2 BJJ gyms and built my own software because nothing on the market was simple enough.

If you're a gym owner who just wants to:
- Know who's teaching when
- Track what you owe coaches
- Book trial classes without the back-and-forth

This might be for you. Just launched the waiting list.

Curious - what's the #1 thing you hate about your current gym software?
